BEGINNING,intro,,,—,q001,,,"As a fourteen year old girl from a magical family in the secret land of Belvig, you’re expected to attend Aeithlynik, the private National School for Young Witches.  Considering how your mother and grandmother and her mother and grandmother all attended Aeithlynik, you know you’re guaranteed an invitation to attend, but that does not mean you can skip the application."
q001,,,,BEGINNING,q002,,,"The application is a long-held tradition for Aeithlynik.  The Headmistress, Agatha McMillan, reads each and every application to determine whether they’re a good fit for her school.  If a girl passes, the professors all read over her letter to decide the major of study for which she’d be best suited.  If a girl fails, she is declined an invitation and encouraged to attend the public, co-education magical school at the bottom of the hill."
q002,,,,q001,q003,,,"As the summer before your potential first year, you sit down to write your letter of interest to the school.  Headmistress McMillan has provided a guide to every girl who is known to possess magical ability, a template for writing this letter.  It’s both for peace of mind for the student, and ease for her to determine a candidate’s potential for the school."

The headmistress’s letter also requested you include your school transcript and a list of your best skills.  It’s short work before they’re all tucked safely away in the envelope.  You seal it, admiring how thick and puffy the contents are, and know that all that remains is to send it to Aeithlynik so they can decide your fate."

You should receive a letter from them shortly about enrolling.  Admission into Aeithlynik is rigorous, but it is possible to transfer in with a commendable first year at the public school.
